# 12-employee-tracker

## Description
Build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.


Walkthrough video:
GitHub Repo:

-Need:
    <!-- [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries -->
    <!-- [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to interact with the user via the command line -->
    <!-- [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console -->
    -make queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the [npm documentation on MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).
    -separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries
        -A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these
    <!-- -seeds.sql -->
    <!-- -query.sql -->
    <!-- -schema.sql -->

## Bonus

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* Update employee managers.

* View employees by manager.

* View employees by department.

* Delete departments, roles, and employees.

* View the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.




* The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a functional menu with the options outlined in the acceptance criteria.
